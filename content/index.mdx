Hello! 안녕! I am **Jason Choi (최지원)**, a Software Engineer at [Match Group](https://mtch.com) based in Seoul.

Before joining Match Group, I was a Research Assistant at [Interactive Data Computing Lab](https://idclab.skku.edu), under the supervision of [Prof. Jaemin Jo](https://www.jaeminjo.com).
I also interned at [NAVER HyperCLOVA](https://clova.ai/en) and [NAVER Smart Studio](https://smartstudio.tech).

My research focuses on automating data analysis to make these tasks more accessible to a broader audience.
To this end, I design novel algorithms and develop interactive techniques.
My work has been published in leading visualization venues, including IEEE VIS, IEEE PacificVis, and EG/IEEE EuroVis.

I received a Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science & Engineering in 2025, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science Education in 2023 from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/index.do).
